        Here is a little information that might help people get to know me. I am originally from <strong>Australia</strong> but have been living in the <strong>US</strong> for 11 years now. I became a citizen in July of 2014. I hope that this page explains and shows a little bit about me!

        <p>
          Here is a little background on me. I was born in <strong>Sydney, Australia</strong> in 1992 and moved to <a href="http://travel.usnews.com/Melbourne_Australia/Things_To_Do/">Melbourne</a> when I was around 2. I lived there until I was 10 when my family moved to the <em>UK</em>. I lived there for 2 more years before moving back to Melbourne for another year. After that I came stateside and have lived here ever since.

              - This was the first project that I worked on. It was a simple website using html where we said "hello world" in 5 different languages. After that we added "goodbye world" in Japanese and Pig latin.
